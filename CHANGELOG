1.0.0
=====

This version is a major refactoring to only support latest DRF and ease future maintenace, plus ensuring least privilege by default.

Dropped features
  - Officially only support DRF (vanilla Django might still work fine but not thoroughly tested)
  - Totally drop support for function-based views
  - Totally drop support for 'allowed' and 'disallowed' decorators

New features
  - Least privileges by default

Changes
  - Rename setting 'roles' to 'ROLES'
  - Views found in view_permissions are patched explicitly to go via our framework
  - Add RolePermission, and make it patched by default on classes without permission_classes
  - Several fixes and more tests to ensure we don't check permissions way too many times for cyclic views (redirections)


0.4.1
=====

  - Support for Django 3
  - Support for Django REST Framework
  - Support both class-based and function-based views
